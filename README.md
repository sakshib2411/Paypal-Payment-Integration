# Paypal-Payment-Integration

Project: PayPal Payment Integration
Built core REST API integration with PayPal using Java SpringBoot in a microservices architecture hosted on AWS. Contributed to end-to-end integration of PayPal Standard Checkout, including order management APIs, reconciliation logic, payment status tracking, OAuth 2.0-based security, and exception handling. Independently explored and integrated Redis Cache and Spring Scheduler. Followed REST standards, applied design patterns for modularity, and demonstrated strong debugging and problem-solving skills.

Responsibilities: 
Finalized integration approach after exploring PayPal Standard Checkout documentation and collaborating with the team.
Developed paypal-provider-service integrating with PayPal REST APIs: Create Order, Capture Order, Show Order.
Designed and implemented reconciliation logic ensuring 100% payment lifecycle completion with no unsettled transactions.
Managed payment status tracking and lifecycle transitions from initiation to completion.
Secured API communication using OAuth 2.0 (Client Credentials grant).
Built robust error handling system with custom error codes and centralized exception handling in Spring Boot.
Implemented microservices with circuit breaker for fault tolerance and integrated distributed logging using Micrometer. 
Used Spring JDBC with MySQL for efficient data access and transaction persistence.
Implemented Redis cache to optimize access token management for outbound API calls.
Applied design patterns like Factory and Builder to ensure modular and scalable system architecture.
Deployed services using AWS EC2, managed database with RDS, and secrets with AWS Secrets Manager.
Wrote unit tests with JUnit & Mockito, maintaining high code coverage and reliability.
Followed Agile Scrum; awarded STAR Performer for timely delivery and supporting sprint goals.
